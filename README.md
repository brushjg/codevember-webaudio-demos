Codevember 2016 demos
Todo:
- learn markdown
- I don't think babel is actually doing anything
- switch jquery to require from script tag

Refactoring
- move more things into functions
- general code cleanup
- comments, comments, comments
- current size of 64 should be set by a param. n^2,  4^2 = 16 is easier for testing

Moving on
- match tones generated to colors red = 440hz, blue = 110 hz, etc...
- types of waves are randomly switched
- after everything is down, a button click will recolor everything randomly.
- different animations for translate Y into position
